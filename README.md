# Fractions
A small program that can calculate with precise fractions.
The Fraction struct works with BigIntegers but can implicitly and explicitly be converted to most other numerical ValueTypes in C#.
The FractionMath class provides a few extra's that enable taking the root or the power of a fraction and a more precise approximation method.
